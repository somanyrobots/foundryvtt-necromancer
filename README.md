This is the official Foundry VTT module for the [Necromancer Class](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-OQt-3vTm_R5b8dr6fCV) for D&D 5E and compatible games, by somanyrobots.

You can install the module directly via the manifest link at https://github.com/somanyrobots/foundryvtt-necromancer/releases/latest/download/module.json. (Note the manifest linked directly from the code repository won't work; there's some processing that happens to it during releases.)
